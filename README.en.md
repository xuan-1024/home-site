## MCP Server

TaiBu runs a public MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes every metaphysics tool to compatible agents. It now serves MCP `2026-07-28` and keeps stateless compatibility for 2025-era clients.

### Quick Setup

Import this server entry into your MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "taibu": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://mcp.mingai.fun/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Modern clients automatically perform `server/discover` and supply the per-request protocol metadata; no OAuth, API key, or session header is required. For a fully local stdio setup, see [`packages/mcp/README.md`](packages/mcp/README.md).

### Supported Tools

| `bazi_pillars_resolve` | Reverse-lookup birth time from Four Pillars (1900-2100) | "My Bazi is 丙午 庚寅 丙辰 癸巳, please analyze it." |

### SDK

If you want to call the calculation engine directly in your own Node.js project (without MCP), use the core library:

```bash
npm install taibu-core
```

See [taibu-core on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/taibu-core) and [packages/core/README.md](packages/core/README.md) for full API docs and subpath exports.
